# Sales vs Marketing Dashboard - KajoDataProducts

## Project Overview
This project aimed to check if there is a relationship between blog entries and YouTube views and sales of KajoData products. The analysis was conducted based on data for the period I - V 2024. This is an educational project aimed at reinforcing knowledge from online courses.

## Technologies Used
- **Tableau**: Utilized for data modeling, creating measures and designing the dashboard visualizations.

 ## Main Conclusion
Considering the period of the analysis (5 months) and only 2 factors (YT/Blog views) that were taken into account in this study, it should be stated that they have an impact on sales, but it is not possible to determine to what extent they interact.

It should be noted that, in addition to YT/Blog views, other factors that were not taken into account in the analysis could have had an impact on sales, such as: Kajo's activities on LinkedIN (which we know are intensive), word of mouth, recommendations from friends, etc. The factors given can translate into sales either directly or indirectly through building your own brand, arousing interest, people's reactions, etc.

This is confirmed by the chart of orders over time, where we can observe 4 characteristic periods with an increase in sales, which were not reflected in a significant increase in YT/Blog views.

 ## Other observations
 - YT/Blog views are relatively at a similar level throughout the analysis period, with higher dynamics of change visible in YT views
 - YT activities have a greater impact on sales than blogging and blog posts. This can be clearly seen in May, where the average conversion on the site was the lowest (2.82%), with the number of sales (90) being the third best result in the period under review. On the other hand, the highest conversion was in February (3.76%), and this month recorded the lowest sales. As can be seen, in both cases the conversion level (CTR) did not reflect the sales volume well.
 - The most popular product is the purchase of access / subscription to the KajoDataSpace community
